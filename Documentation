# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Project Documentation

## Executive Summary
Project Duration: [Duration]
Tools Used: Python, SQL, Tableau, Scikit-learn
Dataset: 7,043 customer records
Key Achievement: 85% prediction accuracy

## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Business Problem
- High customer churn rate affecting revenue
- Need for predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers
- Requirement for data-driven retention strategies

### 1.2 Technical Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- Predictive modeling using Machine Learning
- SQL analysis for customer segmentation
- Interactive visualization using Tableau

## 2. Technical Implementation
### 2.1 Data Preprocessing (Python)


# Key preprocessing steps
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Data cleaning
df['TotalCharges'] = pd.to_numeric(df['TotalCharges'], errors='coerce')
df['TotalCharges'].fillna(df['TotalCharges'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Feature engineering
numeric_cols = ['tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']
categorical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

-- Churn Rate Analysis
SELECT 
    Contract,
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as churned_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as churn_rate
FROM customer_data
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;


2.3 Machine Learning Implementation
Model Selection: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
